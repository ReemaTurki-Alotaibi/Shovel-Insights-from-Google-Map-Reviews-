☕ Google Maps Reviews Sentiment Analysis: Shovel Roastery Alyasmin🚀 Project OverviewThis repository contains a robust Python pipeline for extracting, cleaning, translating, and analyzing sentiment from Google Maps reviews, specifically focusing on Shovel Roastery's Al Yasmin branch. The project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including hybrid Arabic sentiment models and sophisticated data visualization, to uncover customer insights and trend dynamics.✨ Key FeaturesData Acquisition: Scraped reviews using the Apify Google Maps Reviews Scraper.Data Preparation: Converts relative Arabic dates (e.g., "قبل 3 يوم") to absolute timestamps for time-series analysis.Multi-Language Handling: Automatically detects language and translates English reviews into Arabic using the deep-translator library.Hybrid Arabic Sentiment Analysis: Leverages two state-of-the-art HuggingFace models (CAMeL-Lab BERT and AraBERTv2) for high-accuracy sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral).Advanced Arabic NLP: Implements enhanced text cleaning, including Normalization (Alef, Yeh, Ta Marbuta) and Diacritics removal, crucial for accurate Arabic NLP.Visualization & Insights: Generates interactive Sentiment Trend over Time plots (Plotly), WordClouds, and N-Gram frequency charts for each sentiment category, ensuring correct Arabic (RTL) rendering.🛠️ Tools and LibrariesCategoryTools/Libraries UsedPurposeData ScrapingApify Google Maps Reviews ScraperExtracted raw review data from the target location.Core LibrariesPandas, NumPy, TqdmData manipulation, numeric computation, and progress tracking.NLP & MLHuggingFace transformers (CAMeL, AraBERTv2), NLTKSentiment modeling and Arabic text tokenization/stop words.Translationlangdetect, deep-translatorLanguage identification and English-to-Arabic translation.VisualizationPlotly, Matplotlib, WordCloudInteractive time-series plots, box plots, and custom Arabic visualizations.Arabic Supportarabic-reshaper, python-bidiEnsures correct Right-to-Left (RTL) text display.📦 RequirementsThe project requires the following packages.
